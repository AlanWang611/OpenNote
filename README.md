OpenNote
--------
About:
    Text editors are something that we use everyday to perform everyday tasks. It's pretty unremarkable. But, what if we can make text editors do special things? What if we can customize a text editor to fit our needs? This is where OpenNote comes in. OpenNote is an open-sourced, crowd-sourced text editor where the sky is the limit.
Purpose:
    The idea behind this project is sort of like a sleeper PC build; where the computer itself is an old-fashioned 90s PC, but inside it packs the latest graphics cards and CPUs. In this way, this app uses the Metal Java Swing theme and the design is purposely understated. However, under the hood, one can build in Alexa integration, smart suggestions, text-to-speech, you name it.
